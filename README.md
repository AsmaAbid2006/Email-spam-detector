# Email-spam-detector
A machine learning model which uses semi-supervised learning for E-mail spam detector.
It uses semi-supervised learning which means 20 percent data is labeled and 80 percent data is not labeled. 
I downloaded a dataset from github through a link which is a part of code so o need to download dataset seperately.
every step is commented and explained clearly.
